# Hotel-Domain-Analysis-using-Python

Problem Statement


Atliq Grands, a big name in India's hotel industry, is currently dealing with tough competition and a drop in earnings. To tackle these problems, the management team has decided to use data and smart insights. Since they don't have experts in-house for handling data, they've asked for outside help to look at the situation, give practical advice, and come up with good plans to keep customers and boost revenue.

Project Goal

I want to use Python to thoroughly examine the hotel industry. I aim to provide Atliq Grands with useful insights and suggestions based on data analysis. The goal is to help them make informed decisions and stay competitive in the market.

Project Highlights

Sure, here's a simplified version of the tasks you mentioned using more straightforward language:

1. **Handling Missing Values and Outliers:**
   - Cleaned up the data by filling in missing values and dealing with unusual data points.

2. **Data Transformation:**
   - Added a new column called "Occupancy Percentage" to better understand how full the rooms are.

3. **Insights Generation:**
   - Answered key questions such as:
     - What is the average occupancy rate for each room type in each city?
     - How does the occupancy rate differ on weekdays versus weekends?
     - What is the revenue generated per city?
     - Are there any trends in monthly revenue?
     - How does revenue vary across different booking platforms?

4. **Calculating Average Occupancy Rate:**
   - Determined the average occupancy rate for each room type and city.

5. **Identifying Occupancy Rate on Weekdays and Weekends:**
   - Explored how room occupancy rates change between weekdays and weekends.

6. **Analyzing Revenue Generated per City:**
   - Examined the revenue generated in each city to identify potential trends or patterns.

7. **Analyzing Monthly Revenue Trends:**
   - Investigated the trends in revenue on a monthly basis.

8. **Assessing Revenue by Booking Platforms:**
   - Explored how revenue varies across different booking platforms.
